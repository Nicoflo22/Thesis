# The Impact of Lead Variation on Electrocardiograms Classification Using Deep Learning

## Description
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the impact of varying the number of leads on the classification of electrocardiograms (ECGs) using deep learning on the PTB-XL dataset. The study delves into different deep learning architectures including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Residual Networks (ResNet), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Transformers to evaluate their effectiveness in ECG classification. The analysis further breaks down the classification into three datasets: binary, superclasses, and subclasses, and investigates the performance metrics across varying lead configurations.

## Requirements
To reproduce the results and run the notebook, ensure you have the necessary packages installed. You can install them using the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset
The analysis makes use of the PTB-XL dataset, which is a large publicly available dataset of ECGs. You can access and download the dataset [here](https://physionet.org/content/ptb-xl/1.0.1/).

## Usage
To reproduce the results, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required packages.
3. Download the PTB-XL dataset and place it in the appropriate directory.
4. Run the provided notebook.
